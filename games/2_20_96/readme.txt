## Ninja Rabbit – Lines + Free Spin Modes

* 5 reels, 5 rows  
* 15 paylines  
* 10 paying symbols  
* 2 types of Wilds:  
  - WR (Wild Rabbit – expanding wild reel with multiplier)  
  - WC (Wild Carrot – wild symbol with multiplier)  
* 1 type of Scatter (S)

### Basegame

Standard lines game rules with wilds paying on 3, 4, and 5-of-a-kind.  
Wild Carrots (WC) can appear on any reel with a random multiplier from 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, or 10x.  
Wild Rabbits (WR) can land and expand upward to fill the reel.  
If a WR expands through WC symbols, it collects their multipliers.  
Multipliers are multiplied, not added (e.g., 3x * 5x = 15x).  
Final line wins are affected by the total WR multiplier on that reel.

### Bonus 1 – Free Spins

Triggered by landing 3 or more Scatters, or by Bonus Buy 1 (costs 100x).  
Awards 10 free spins.  
Increased chance of landing WR and WC symbols.  
Each WR that lands expands and multiplies through any WC it collects.  
Rabbit reels are not sticky in this mode.

### Bonus 2 – Sticky Rabbit Free Spins

Triggered by landing 5 Scatters or Bonus Buy 2 (costs 300x).  
Awards 10 free spins.  
WRs are sticky — they reappear in the same reel each spin.  
At the start of each spin, sticky WRs retract, then expand upward again.  
Each time they expand, they collect and multiply any new WC multipliers they pass through.  
The multiplier stacks spin after spin.  
No retriggers.

### Feature Spin

A feature spin costs 10x and guarantees at least 2 WRs to land.  
WC symbols may also appear and be collected by the WRs.  
Offers a shortcut to experience WR mechanics in the basegame.

### Bonus Hunt Mode

Costs 2x per spin and gives 3x increased chance to trigger a free spin bonus.
